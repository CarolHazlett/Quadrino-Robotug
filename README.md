# Quadrino-Robotug
Code for the Lynxmotion Quadrino Nano Quadcopter control system to autonomously run an RC tugboat.
I will be adding the files as I develop them over the next couple of weeks.  I am using a Zippkits
Twin Tugster kit with the Quadrino as the navigation system.  Pictures of this project can be found
on facebook.com/Robothon.
