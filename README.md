# Quadrino-Robotug
Code for the Lynxmotion Quadrino Nano Quadcopter control system to autonomously run an RC tugboat.
I will be adding the files as I develop them over the next couple of weeks.  I am using a Zippkits
Twin Tugster kit with the Quadrino as the navigation system.  Pictures of this project can be found
on facebook.com/Robothon.
I had to change my plans with this project and go a different route. I could find no way to stop the
automatic mixing the Nano did with the different motors so I could never get the boat motors and
rudder to act independtly. The program is made for quads and can not be modified enought to use on a
ground vehicle.
I chose to use an Arduino Uno and have direct control of each mechanical part.
